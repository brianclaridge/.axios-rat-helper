# axios-rat-scan

Cross-platform scanner for the [axios supply chain RAT](https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/axios-one-rat-to-rule-them-all) (2026-03-31). Single static binary, no dependencies.

Compromised versions `axios@1.14.1` and `axios@0.30.4` inject `plain-crypto-js@4.2.1`, which drops a cross-platform RAT attributed to DPRK/UNC1069 (WAVESHAPER).

~100 million weekly downloads affected. Installation to full compromise: ~15 seconds.

## What it checks

| Phase | What |
|---|---|
| **Host artifacts** | RAT files (`wt.exe`, `system.bat`, `com.apple.act.mond`, `/tmp/ld.py`), temp dropper files (`6202033.*`), SHA-256 hash verification |
| **Registry** | `HKCU\...\Run\MicrosoftUpdate` persistence, script-in-temp persistence (Windows) |
| **Processes** | Running RAT processes, parent-child chains (node->shell->curl), renamed binary proxy, `osascript` dropper, spoofed IE8 User-Agent, C2 domains in cmdlines |
| **Network** | TCP connections to C2 (`142.11.206.73:8000`, `sfrclak.com`, `packages.npm.org`), DNS cache inspection, hosts file tampering |
| **npm packages** | `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock` for compromised axios versions, `plain-crypto-js`, secondary vectors (`@shadanai/openclaw`, `@qqbrowser/openclaw-qbot`) |
| **node_modules** | Installed malicious packages, injected deps in axios, `setup.js` dropper with hash check |

## Elastic Detection Rule Coverage

Based on [Elastic Security Labs detection rules](https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/axios-supply-chain-compromise-detections):

- Curl or Wget Spawned via Node.js
- Process Backgrounded by Unusual Parent
- Execution via Renamed Signed Binary Proxy
- Suspicious URL as argument to Self-Signed Binary
- Suspicious String Value Written to Registry Run Key
- Startup Persistence via Windows Script Interpreter

## Testing

```bash
# Run integration tests in Docker (builds Linux binary, scaffolds 100 projects with 4 infected)
task test
```

22 assertions, 33 critical findings detected, zero false positives.

## Build from source

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Exit codes

- `0` — clean
- `1` — critical findings detected
